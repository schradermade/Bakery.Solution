# _Schrader's Bakery_

#### _Console application written in C# that allows users to order bread and pastries_

#### By _**Nathan Schrader**_

## Description
This console application was developed in my 8th week at Epicodus Coding School. It is written in C# with a Model-View-Controller design pattern. The emphasis of this independent project was on creating custom Classes and Namespaces, as well as auto-implemented Properties. This application allows a user to purchase Bread at $5.00 dollars per loaf and Pastries at $2.00 each. Additional logic is implemented to offer a 'Daily Deal' on each: Bread is 'buy 2 get 1 free', and Pastries are '3 for $5.00 dollars'. Users are then presented with a screen-printed reciept at the end of their order, summarizing the total for Bread and Pastries individually, as well as displaying the savings on each resulting from the Daily Deal.
